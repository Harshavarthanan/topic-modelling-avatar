gandy74,"Somebody downthread mentioned something about James Cameron talking about excess testosterone combined with adrenaline and how it made him overly aggressive and reckless when he was young but now he's mellowed.  I'm sure he was a major asshole but IMO, it's that alpha male &quot;king of the world&quot; aggression and having something to prove that make his earlier movies so incredibly compelling and memorable. Cameron has lost his fire, drive and intensity. Same thing happens to a lot of artists who are now a shadow of their former greatness.

🔱Lina- Gо T0 MY Ch@nnel LIVE (now)🔱,"1 thing that I loved about Avatar 1 was the implication of intricate ecosystems of virtual creatures. I'm seeing so many more creatures just from these shots. They didn't have to add that many variety of underwater plants and sunfish-like creatures, but they did. It's obvious that they recognize that strength from the first movie. I am already satisfied. Just put a bunch of shot of the Navi people playing around with whales and other animals, and I'll be immensely satisfied.",2022-11-29T06:12:01Z,1,0

Unfortunately given the advancements after the release of the first film, it's even less of an incentive to sit through a mediocre story just for the special effects. <br><br>I hope this film still does well though. Everyone who worked on it deserves to at least be paid.",2022-11-27T10:05:28Z,0,2

Random Guy,Dude used to be a truck driver. Now he's a Hollywood driver. <br><br>Seriously though I'm really hoping this movie has a better storyline than the original. Avatar was probably the only movie he made I didn't really care for. It just seems like everyone I know watched Avatar in theater but nobody actually liked the movie all that much. <br><br>Then again I love most of Christopher Nolans movies. Interstellar in IMAX was truly remarkable though I have friends who hated that movie soooo....,2022-11-27T06:15:52Z,0,1

Don Robertson,"Looks like another high dollar production promoting the occult mother earth type worship idolatry of the left. It fits the leftist liberal worldview that puts people out of work, weakens American industry, and values animals and plants more than human life.  It rejects the Christian view that mankind is special and created in the image of the personal God who created all things.  This movie also promotes the false view of the New Age movement.  Hollywood just keeps trying to brainwash the public.  If you watch this movie, watch it with a caution and discernment.",2022-11-23T20:27:36Z,0,0

Maksym Baziliuk,"This is a trailer like this, you go to the cinema and watch, then you will say, it's clear that the first film was fascinating, since then computer graphics were just beginning to develop, and now graphon has reached its peak, and people will not be surprised so easily because everyone is already used to graphon, now look at the black and white movie you 'll get goosebumps .But I 'm not waiting for a graphon from the second part , Cameron waited 12 years because there were no norms of recording technologies under water , he himself invested a billion bucks in the development of this technology , and I want to see it .He said that when he watched Aquaman and that recording underwater , he just wanted to cry .In addition, they have developed motion capture technology and 3D processing in real time, let's see what happens))",2022-11-23T09:13:17Z,2,0

Phil Fedorowick,"I know that the focus of these movies has always been Pandora itself and the alien creatures, but I'm v excited to see more of the Human tech from the first movie.

MatteoFrance,"I imagine that everyone who craps on avatar because of the story hates every single Marvel/DC/other disney movie, am I right? Because in terms of story they are ALL EXACTLY the same and are not even comparable in terms of cinematography to the first avatar... Why in those cases everyone is like &quot;oh come on, It's entrateinment, It doesn't have to be complex&quot; and with avatar that doesn't apply? It doesn't want to be a masterpiece, It's an experience and the story is better than most &quot;bad guy vs good guy&quot; in the current cinecomics... But no everyone has to crap on it because &quot;yea bad story&quot;",2022-11-21T16:33:33Z,3,0

leak leak,I took a white girl to the movies we went to see the new Doctor strange when seeing this we saw the trailer for this movie. I told her they made them blue because if they would have made them black people really wouldn't have watched it. I told her to look at the hair they're really supposed to be black. And she started freaking out during the trailer  having a little rage. I should have left her ass there 😑 after the movie just seeing that,2022-11-20T06:22:09Z,0,1

☆𓆩EXOCET𓆪☆,"You know, as a pilot one of the things I really respected was the Sampson 2 helicopter. And all the aviation equipment. Except for that giant quad copter thing. All those space ships and aircraft are by design and operation, airworthy. I wouldn't be surprised if somone had taken the time to call up an actual aeronautical and aerospace engineer to get their input or ideas. The Helicopter is 100% feasible but it isn't the safest design you could have which is why you only see few helicopters with 2 rotors.",2022-11-14T07:40:23Z,0,1

When Scarlett Johanson is worth at least 100 mill and The Rock who just made his first movie to gross over 300 million that he headlined and it is about 800 million (and ik some of that is WWE too) but Zoe Saladana is being incredibly underpaid rn, it's quite insane, she's not making a fuss about it, she probably doesn't even care bc she's still rich and wealthy, but she's definitely worth way more than what they're paying her",2022-11-13T21:11:55Z,1,0

Unrelenting 4444,I may receive some rotten eggs throws at me but...<br>I hope they didn't make &quot;humans&quot; in this movie 100% evil force. Because in the first movie I was rooting for humans to win and I was really disappointed with the twist when nature itself helped the tribe to defeat humans. Such a great movie deserves a bit of grey moral this time !,2022-11-09T19:39:10Z,1,2

Matien Azemy,"<b>Alright since there’s isn’t much explanation of what the story is about, here’s my attempt on giving a short synopsis based on the two trailers and the released pictures:</b><br><br>It’s been 13 years since the first film and Jake and Neytiri have their own family. Meanwhile the RDA (now called Console) is back with an army of avatars, one of them being Colonel Miles Quaritch. After the destruction of the Omaticaya’s home in the forests, Jake and the gang are forced to take refuge with the Metkayina clan near Pandora’s oceans. However, they’re not being accepted because of Jake’s adopted human son. War and/or tragedy hits causing the Metkayina to accept Jake’s family and join forces against the RDA/Console. Meanwhile, Jake’s adopted daughter Kiri is having an important spiritual awakening, and Jake’s adopted human son Spider is doing his very best to fit in. Quaritch is back with a vengeance.",2022-11-09T07:59:54Z,6,3

MeowmixCat,I haven't been to a movie theater since Covid had it's major outbreak back in 2020 (I probably last went in 2019). This is the ONE movie that I'll go back to it for. (with protection of course because... yeah) I saw the first one in the theater once in 3D and twice regular. Loved it so much I got the Extended Collectors Edition - maybe they should show that one in the theaters before this one comes out? I'd go again just to see that one on the big screen too.,2022-11-08T02:27:08Z,1,3

Like the big yellow leaf, the grass, the alien leafes,  the sand they fought, the sea they splashed , the dreadlocks on characters, some garments, even thier skin  or eyes partly mimic n complete it ( could have painted their faces n texture them and extrapolate ) instead of drawing everything on it etc. Very foolish.

I haven't been to the cinema since the dreadful new Star Wars movies.  I'm looking forward to watching this in the cinema.  I wonder, will Avatar Way of the Water make 3 billion!!!!!!!

This looks equally as un exciting. I can't see why people are saying it looks real either. (Funny as how can something look real if it doesnt actually exist in reality?) Perhaps it's just so far away from my type of movie, I'm not a fantasy fan.

Ich hoffe James Cameron macht bald mal wieder was er am besten kann.. etwas Neues, ganz ohne Greenscreen, ohne Freimaurersymbolik und nervige Computerbombaseffekte aber dafür ein geniales Drehbuch, ohne Logikfehler wie am Fließband.. und neue Gesichter! Echte Kameras, echte Landschaften und echt tallentierte Schauspieler die noch keiner gesehen hat, das wär mal was Neues! 🎈",2022-11-06T16:28:25Z,0,0

Flac Wave,"Imma be honest...I don't really know how the first movie became the most successful film of all time. I don't remember a single line from the film, or a single character's name, or much of the film's story. I remember the sleep pods, the main character running through the sports field as his avatar, the mechs, the flying islands, the big tree and the living usb connectors everyone had, and that's about it. I never expected a sequel, the first movie just kind of came and went for me - a beautiful spectacle I didn't really remember much of. Disney's Atlantis basically tells the same story and I remember that one far more. But hey this is cool I guess as long as it's made with a passion for the Avatar universe and not just for cash cow purposes.",2022-11-06T15:45:13Z,4,0

Reamusray,Love the subnautica looking prawn suit... I hope that a good 80% of this film is water based. Would love to see all the depths and ocean life of Pandora. I think James Cameron's interest in the ocean will benefit this film greatly. Maybe his trip down the Mariana Trench has given him loads of conceptual ideas. Hype levels are massive.,2022-11-05T20:56:34Z,3,3

Bet they also liked Rings of power too. haha.  This is a pass for most ppl. This movie will lose money.",2022-11-05T14:26:23Z,3,2

I Watch YouTube.,Ok here is my plot<br><br>Jake and Neytiri tribe gets attacked and they are the few survivors. Soon they travel to a new clan were they are not truly welcome nor trusted. They managed to settle in experience their new home and water life. Soon after they spot rda recon on their tail. A couple of their children got captured and Jake and Neytiri needs the new clan help to get them back because they have their daughter captured as well. The clans huddled up to fight and it is a gore some battle between both but at the end I believe the rda gets the upper hand. Plus major plot twist either Jake or Neytiri dies which sets up for the next movie.,2022-11-05T07:57:34Z,1,0

Destiney Townsend,"I watched the Trailer of Avatar before it ever hit nationwide screens. It was a social thing where we got paid some cash to rate trailers for a few minutes. first without sound, the trailer gave such an experience. I was able to get the concept right away. and we explained our experience, then we watched it with the sound an I was so intrigued that I hoped I would see the trailer soon. The months later maybe even a year later or 2, not 100%. The trailer I had seen in Vegas came on tv. I was so excited to see the movie. It was amazing. I cannot wait for The Way of Water. It'll be truly breathtaking.",2022-11-05T01:44:50Z,0,0

Cole DiBiase,"I'm so curious what the story would be about.<br>The first movie was really good at not painting the humans as generic bad guys, they tried FOR YEARS to peacefully exist on the planet and mine the unobtainium, they tried diplomacy and trade, and even created the Avatar program to be able to interact without making the native population feel uncomfortable and the natives were the ones who chose violence.<br>Remember, without unobtainium everyone on earth dies, period, no debate, so obviously the humans were coming back, but why don't the humans just carpet bomb the planet? Obviously because the humans aren't mindlessly evil and they dont want to exterminate the natives.<br><br>In the first movie, when did the humans decided to attack the soul tree? After they watched an army of hundred's or thousands amassing to destroy them on what was literally just a mining operation, remember the generals job was security.",2022-11-04T19:55:25Z,1,1

Hammer n'Bells,"I'm def not trying to sound above it all when I say this but, I'm almost shocked how much I don't care. I've had a professional career reviewing films, working on sets, and making them so generally I can easily articulate what I do and don't like and how it can be altered. But with Avatar it's odd because it's just pure apathy. It could be free on TV right now and I'd not watch. I LIVE sci-fi and fantasy and tribal culture (Prey and See definitely did it for me recently) but Avatar is like 🤷🏿‍♂️. Anyone else feeling this way please explain to me why.",2022-11-04T13:38:17Z,1,0

DiMitRu,"The Way Of WATER kind of explains why there isn't much greenery in the trailer, rather, there is so much, you know, water. Nearly no humans in the trailer. I do hope not all of them are going to be the bad guys. I like the moment when Jake says &quot;strong heart&quot; because it channels the first movie. As for the CGI, well, it is mostly awesome. But I have to admit the flying creatures move in weird ways. Like they're mechanical or something. They looked better in the first movie. They felt like real creatures with real bodies, real muscles beneath the skin and so on. These just look like colourful robots to me. I'm a bit disappointed by that. But I do like the trailer because it does not cut to black all the time and the music is wonderful, and again, in general, it looks awesome.",2022-11-04T11:52:52Z,0,0

evolve,"Strong heart. I love it. ;) Come on now strong hearts. You can do it. ;) hehe<br>Yeah this one seems deep and epic. Also, they must win over the military.. I hope so. The good must win in the end.. Also, machines overall. It's not good.. That tribe is wise. The blue tribe.  The Na'vis. Long live the the Na'vi's ;) I'm curious about water though.. Deep thinking in this one.<br>How are sapiens still so lost. Wars.. How hard can it be to live in harmony.. The internet is a wierd invention btw. Evolve like the na'vis. Become blue. Just kidding. <br>I also don't see how skin could be blue. It would be dark, grey or light right... There would have to be some kind of element that turned them blue. Why are they blue even.. It's because it looks like water right, or cinematic. Blue is a rare color, and in skin? Nah.. Dont makes sense to me... ok i did watch quick. They evolved from like blue tigers, or blue lions.. Looks cool. Still don't see how they would be blue.. Allot of features, i'm gonna stop rambling and &quot;over analyzing&quot;. Good artists! This is sci-fi! :) Their attitude is wise, etc. <br><br>I can only dream of... I mean.. if the universe is infinity though.. hmm. OK a wierd thought, but this could be reality somewhere, like the avatar movies even. That is a wierd, or a deep thought. hmm! The couple even.. hmm. Now i sound crazy.. But i mean hypothetical of-course. ;) The universe is big. Dimensions, galaxies, planets.. you know.. What do we even know. ;) In some reality.. somewhere, sometime.. Maybe. Or most definitely... perhaps. Gotta have critical thinking. These movies makes me wanna join an advanced &quot;primitive&quot; tribe btw.. Nothing wrong with living in harmony with nature.. Some do still exist in some rain-forests i reckon.. I don't think that would ever happen, but yeah.. <br>Some natural tribes are smarter then many.",2022-11-04T09:19:46Z,0,0

If u wanna be saved today read this.<br>The Bible says we are saved by believing in the Gospel by realising we are sinners Romans 3:23 and hell is the result of our sins Romans 6:23.<br>And to go to heaven we need to be perfect revelation 21:27. But God says we can't earn our salvation because we aren't perfect but we can be saved through the blood of Jesus alone Ephesians 2 8 9 so we  have it by Grace.  we simply believe on Jesus Christ's   death burial and resurrection saved us. 2Corinthians 5:21 and 1 Corinthians 15:1-4.<br>And it's only by believing John 3:16, John 6:47.

I feel and have been treated as an outcast, but I still feel the connection. The world around us is alive, the earth is alive. We are but one part of the entire earth system. We must care for each other and all living things. The first film reflects that struggle and fight perfectly, and I am oh so excited for this one, its going to be revolutionary.

Later in history books: &quot;It turned out that their spears were no match for our nukes.&quot; I never understood why it was they thought that humanity would just count their losses and leave Pandora alone. If they really wanted that  Unoptanium or whatever it was called, surely they'd send a proper military force next time. When the East India Company failed to secure India, Great Britain annexed it and put it under martial law. A private company nearly wiped out the Na'vi, what's to stop a full military invasion?

Cameron movies get worse......I think he's going senile, or delusional......his ex wife must lafhhing her head off at this trailer! Pathetic, no width the wait.

The Film Post,"Just have to say... never doubt James Cameron. If you look at his filmmaking record, he has made arguably some of the greatest films in the medium. Not to meantion, some of the greatest sequels ever made with 'Aliens' and 'T2: Judgment Day.' This too is a sequel and I have no doubt in my mind that Cameron has given everything he's got to make this potentially one of the greatest films of this decade. Especially since he gives himself 10 or so years to make them properly. I appreciate everything he has contributed to the film industry. A true visionary and pioneer and one of the very few remaining.",2022-11-04T02:02:48Z,409,8

Jake,This movie feels extremely stereotypical. Full of special affects and washy action scenes that don't look to be that interesting in the scheme of things. Sure there's more Avatar tribes who resent outcasts cool. The team behind this with such a big budget could of developed a better punchline story then just another army war at the end again. And more inter specie differences this time tribes last time Jake the human as a avatar. Going to the cinema to see the big magical blue world's would be exciting.. but the story is extremely plain and I wouldn't buy the movie stand alone.,2022-11-04T00:26:48Z,0,0

ITS BEEN SO LONG! <br>sad note: My dad took me to see the first Avatar in IMAX, he was so excited for the film that he would show me the trailer al ost daily leading up to its release which was around his birthday.. he would tell me so many minor details that i didn't think i needed to know about CG work, he passed a few years (precovid) back before anything had came out about this.. it's really heartbreaking that he won't be able to see the second entry to the series or see how far its come, it was one of those thing that he was always optimistic about, he knew this movie would eventually happen and that it would (like the first one) be a crazy spectacle... Miss you dad, hope that you get to see this in the afterlife and enjoy it along with me and the rest of the family! damn avatar hitting my feels for too many damn reasons hahah! Thank you for making this film happen, i was worried for a good while that it wouldn't and just to even see more trailers is bringing a bit more light into my life!

tan theman,"I still haven't gotten over the fact that I met one of the security men for James Cameron. I remember it was late at night and I was on the Santa Monica pier with my friend, reenacting the scene from Titanic. Then a security guy came over to evict us from the area. He then proceeded to tell us that the Titanic was a great movie and that James Cameron was working on the new avatar movie. At first I was skeptical because Everyone knows that it's been so long since the last Avatar movie been made. The security guard then proceeded to show the behind the scene photos that he took during the production of Avatar 2. I even became more suspicious because you can't just show these pictures too anyone or James Cameron allowing people to take pictures of the set. Literally, the next morning, the trailer drops for Avatar 2 with the exact same replica of the sets and the green screen for the sets as well as the waters that were in the studio. I knew it was true because the photos had clear as day photos of the water on the sets and how the security guard told us that the plan of the movie is to have a water tribe. I just remember from that day forward. That he confirmed everything and that the trailer for the second movie was real. It was a great experience.",2022-11-03T19:25:27Z,1,0

Cameron better have some amazing visuals or technology to draw in the crowds because &quot;Furn Gully&quot; plots won't cut the mustard anymore. Reading the Youtube comments all I see are 99% bots calling this the best thing ever made, and it hasn't been released yet. Cameron got to spend that marketing money now. Did you know that Titanic was only successful at the time because Cameron convinced studios to put it in every theater on the globe? He's overrated. After Terminator 1 and Aliens he became too obsessed with underwater adventures instead of actual movie making. We'll see!",2022-11-03T17:28:01Z,1,0

One year later, after the tsunami that has washed the planet clean of all indigenous life the humans happily re-land and continue mining operations :-). The new movie name &quot;The Way Of Water&quot; is a typo.

Bellaluna140,"Y’all I don’t understand the hate and backlash this movie is receiving? Like what are y’all talking about the fact the CGI looks bad or it looks crappy it looks boring? Are you guys blind or something James Cameron waited 13 years just to make sure the technology was good enough to produce this. Back in 2009 He could have just released the second movie 3-4 years later knowing the quality and technology wouldnt be at its best becuase it wasn’t advanced at the time. But he didn’t,  he waited more then a DECADE so he can make a picture perfect movie for us viewers. For the viewers who are commenting this looks like shit, or this is boring. How can you generally say that? A trailer doesn’t show the full plot of the movie more just sections of the movie to not fully give away the scenes kept for when it’s out in theaters. What do you want full on spoilers? That’s not what a trailer is about. Just to give a idea what you can expect from the movie. This is all just how I think about this.",2022-11-03T16:43:13Z,1,2

Just like today the blue rays will be dust collecting back stock and surplus movie stores. I’m December I will spend time with my family.",2022-11-03T14:25:43Z,0,0

Ow Lova,"Hi all I just wanted to share something very important. If you don't have a relationship with Jesus Christ as your Lord, here is your sign to turn to Him!   This is the most important thing you'll ever hear in your life. Jesus is coming back soon! God sent His only Begotten Son into the world, that whosoever shall believe on Him shall not perish but have eternal life. Those who do not believe will be condemned. (John 3:16-18). Jesus died for our sins, and to set us free from our sins and condemnation (John 8:36, Acts 13:39). Jesus rose from the the grave 3 days later after His death, defeating death. He now lives forevermore, and seeing we have saving faith in Him,  we too will live eternally with Him! Jesus is the only way to Heaven (John 14:6). Following Him is the best decision to make in life. Though the Christian life isn't a life absent of difficulty, despite any circumstance Jesus gives true peace and fulfillment, a peace and fulfillment this world cannot give (John 14, John 16).",2022-11-03T13:48:32Z,0,0

Nyc Yo,"Idk why but this looks boring to me. Same story, very predictable, sure the effects and visuals are nice but I can watch documentaries of earth if I want to see that stuff. I suggest watching Halo tv series if you thought this looked like action adventure. I think the main problem with this trailer is they show too much and leave nothing to the imagination. They are basically showing you the best the movie has to offer so why watch it? You basically just saw the movie. Trailers that cover movies like this need to show as little as possible in order to really make the viewer appreciate and love it when they see it for real. This is a spoiler trailer. The type that ruins movies for people. Now I have to forget the movie ever exists and try to go into it when it comes out as though don't know or remember anything hopefully.",2022-11-03T13:44:30Z,1,1

MrProy33,"I saw the first one, and never really thought about it again until I heard about a sequel.<br><br>The first one had some neat visuals, but not amazing or anything. It was just colorful cgi.  I thought other films used color more effectively--like Hero,  Crouching Tiger, and What Dreams May Come. The story was convoluted, preachy, and not really subtle. The major plot was actually kinda stupid--tech deficient planet somehow fights off techologically advanced invaders... um yeah, right.  And the minor plot, that stupid love story,  wasn't good. And the wooden performances, lol. The one-dimensional military guy was so cliche, and the male protagonist was just a dummy.<br><br>Not really sure why this needs to be made. I don't remember any burning questions or unanswered philosophical dilemmas that require further explanation. QED, this feels forced, creatively bankrupt.",2022-11-03T13:25:08Z,0,0

Dan Phelps,"No doubt a lot of people went to see the first Avatar movie and it became a box office record winner. What people don't remember is ticket prices for Avatar were raised to cover the cost of the new 3D technology cinemas needed to install in order to screen the movie.<br><br>So the first Avatar did break box office records but only because of the inflated ticket prices.<br><br>At the time, lots of movie goers were excited to see a new James Cameron movie but the other big draw was the chance to see a brand new 3D film technology. In 2009, 3D movies were very rare. If you saw one it was most likely a short film or nature documentary projected at theme park or museum. <br><br>My impression of the first Avatar movie was that the plot was passable and the 3D technology was interesting but tiring after about 20 minutes. Visually, the film had more going for it than standard science fiction films but the over all result was underwhelming.<br><br>While Avatar was an interesting, yet flawed experiment, it's too bad James Cameron wasted all these years focused on Avatar sequels when he could've been making more engaging stand alone projects. <br><br>Avatar 2 will need to get excellent reviews to get me out of the house to see it.",2022-11-03T13:16:12Z,0,0

Martin Kunert,"Avatar was a spectacular 3D movie when it come. But in 13 years that transpired, our real world has moved on. Video game software makers put out demo reels which look this trailer. Check out the work of Unreal Engine and Unity, as examples. In a world where most of the audience may not be as wowed by the visuals as they were once, when 3D lost its allure (if this film is even 3D) and most importantly, when Avatar has not left a cultural impact akin to Harry Potter or Star Wars (how often do you see Halloween costumes from Avatar?); will audiences pay exorbitant ticket prices to see this in cinemas? Or will the await the Netflix release on their giant and cheap flatscreens.",2022-11-03T12:07:05Z,0,0

One of it's biggest selling points was how ahead of its time it was with CGI and effects, which now look standard in this second movie. Not to mention how many of the original characters aren't in the second one. I still plan on seeing it but I don't have huge expectations.",2022-11-03T11:19:32Z,0,0

I'm sure i will change my mind after i have seen it on the big screen, because this movie is obviously made for that format, but on a smartphone this looks too animated, wich it obviously also is😅 I think u get my point😊",2022-11-03T11:10:39Z,0,0

I went to theatre alone, expecting the bald monk to come alive, but confused why the main character is different and all i got was blue tall skinny mutant. Still finish it. Left the theatre amazed of how spectacular the visual is and how good and deep the story is. I'm gonna watch it again with my wife before going for the second.

I loved this movie so much u watched it 11 times and saw it one final time on the 23rd Sept, this time with my husband.

_FAB Brandon & Atarah,Being completely honest here it looks like they took a lot of the same movements and animations from the previous video and added them into here. Even some of the clips themselves I swear were taken directly from the first. Hoping it's just as good as the first.<br><br>Scrolling through the comments and couldn't help but notice 16 posts from 1 person... why? Seems a little redundant.,2022-11-03T08:30:53Z,0,0

The first plot was basically a straight rip off of the Pocahontas theme but sure lets pretend it was original because it had killer cgi. I'll totally watch it like I have the first one it looks cool but reading all the fan boy/girl comments, this isn't ground breaking,  maybe in the visual arts department it has a wow factor, but it looks like a mediocre film at best.",2022-11-03T06:55:03Z,2,0

Courtney,"I saw too many trailers of the original to think I would enjoy it (I much prefer going into a movie completely blind if possible), but man it did not disappoint!  Now I have the conundrum of possibly a  too high expectation for it because the first was so good.

They are making 5 of them and working on them at the same time to be released Dec each year until all of them have been released.

Desiree R,"I was 10 when the original movie came out, and I wasn’t even old enough to go see it by myself so my aunt came and saw it with me. I was, and still am, absolutely in love with this movie and the thing I love the most about it is that the storyline was one that grew with you as you got older and so as I got older this movie became more special to me. Now I’m 23, and to say that I am excited for this movie is an understatement. 13 years of waiting patiently for James Cameron to finish this soon to be masterpiece and I cannot wait to see it!! Just from the trailers, photos, and clips released over the last couple months I can already tell that this movie will be worth the wait. I even got emotional watching this trailer because not only are we seeing the absolutely gorgeous visuals but it’s actually starting to feel real that we are FINALLY getting the sequel. 13 years of waiting and now it’s just a little over a month away. It’s surreal and exciting and I’m counting the days!!",2022-11-03T06:11:58Z,663,23

Alberto Brown,"Todo luce completamente irreal, tanto o mas que un vídeo juego, no entiendo porque en el año 2022 siguen estrenando películas que lucen tan falso, no han aprendido que el CGI envejece muy mal?.<br><br>En 10 años hacia el futuro la gente va a mirar esta película y se va a reír de lo falso que se veía todo, ojalá este comentario sirva para que la gente de el 2033 sepa que aún cercano a la fecha de su estreno, había gente en el 2022 quiénes ya notaban que los gráficos de esta película no eran de una calidad muy realista.<br><br>No entiendo porque no recurrieron al uso de efectos especiales prácticos como maquillaje prosteticos, títere animatronicos, maquetas y modelos en miniatura, como lo resolvió Peter Jackson en la trilogía de &quot;El Señor de los Anillos&quot; a principio de la decada de los 2000's, con excepción de Gollum y el Troll de las cavernas, casi todas las criaturas en esas películas lucen muy bien, aún 20 años después de la fecha de su estreno.<br><br>Considero que fue un grave error por parte de James Cameron confiar casi por completo en la tecnologia de gráficos generados por computadora para contar esta historia, ya que hasta el agua y los paisajes parecen un render 3D de AutoCAD<br><br>En verdad resulta desagradable ver una historia interpretada por estas criaturas que lucen como de plástico o plastilina.<br><br>Aún con todo y lo falso que lucen a la vista humana, no dudó que gracias a un excelente trabajo de marketing y promoción, esta película será otro éxito comercial, así como ocurrió con la primera entrega de esta saga.",2022-11-03T05:23:01Z,0,0

Joshua Engelmann,Anyone else think it's strange having Sigourney Weaver playing a teenager in Avatar 2? I'm sure she's great but it's weird hearing her voice coming out of what's supposed to be a child essentially. I get her original character died in the first film but that was very off-putting for me watching the trailer.,2022-11-03T04:58:27Z,0,0

Humans come and endanger alien species, alien species unites and harnesses the power of their environment and defeat humans. <br><br>But yknow what, I’m still excited for it. Overall, even if it’s the same story, I know it’s going to be told in a magnificent way. And it’s honestly refreshing to see a studio dedicate so much effort into producing something that’s success has been tested and proven.

Why in the world should I care about two fictional alien tribes fighting over water? Maybe they’ll kill each other off so humans can come take their planet.

It was breathtaking, I had never seen anything like it. The characters and environments around them were so detailed that they almost seemed real. My little kid mind imagined myself with the Na'vi riding mountain banshees and jumping from tree to tree. I'm so excited to finally see the second one in the actual theater and get to experience that feeling once again. It will awaken the inner child in all of us, just like the first one did.

And I cannot wait for Avatar 2 to be out in the theatres, I wonder what it has in store for us, I can tell from the trailer it’s already gonna be really good.

Harry's Home,"I remember watching Avatar years after it's been released in 2016, didn't understood why people loved it so much or what was so great about it all those years before I finally took time to watch it myself and oh boy did I regret waiting so long. It was literally the most beautiful film I've ever seen in my life, it immersed me into it. I said to myself how much I'd love it if I was in a world like that, it made me look up at the stars and wonder if it's really out there somewhere in the cosmos and I have a feeling it's real, it actually made me depressed about my human life on earth, I just wished I could be an alien on another planet where I lived amongst a tribe who are my family and friends where I don't have to work just to survive where everyone takes care of each other, where no one starves or suffers and everyone lives in harmony with nature,  It made me forget about how horrible life is on earth for me and billions of others, I just hope after I breathe my last breathe that I'll have another life somewhere out there in the cosmos where I get the blessing to see such beauty for person.",2022-11-03T02:55:31Z,1,1

TRISMUSIK,"Sorry but James Cameron has wasted so much time with Avatar. The first movie was not that good. Every other Cameron film I can watch over and over and never get tired of it. I watched Avatar the first time and didn't care for it. Then I said I'll give it a second chance so I watched it again and still didn't like it. It too cartoonish CGI. I think Cameron should have stuck with the kind of movies he did in the past which are legendary.  Looks more like a videogame than a movie and that's not good. Instead of doing TERMINATOR 3, True LIES 2 and other films that fans wanted,  he did Avatar. When I ask people to name their top 10 movies of all time or just movies that they love, Avatar is never mentioned. NEVER",2022-11-03T02:20:27Z,0,0

"Bring Some Good Beer, Prranjal's Here",This probably is the first ever Hollywood movie where aliens are not evil or extraterrestrial. Humans and aliens find love in each other and together they fight to survive against the real evil of this universe i.e. the human imperialism and the military corporations.,2022-11-03T02:19:31Z,0,0

Biggs G,"For as visually generous as the original Avatar was, it's story was blasé and soulless. For as much as they hyped up that it was like nothing you've ever seen before, Pandora felt very familiar and derivative of other fantasy settings. I want to be excited for this movie, but after the trailer and my experience with the first film, I still feel empty towards the whole endeavor. I'll probably still go see it just to see admire the technical aspects of the film, but I hope I'm pleasantly surprised by story side of things.",2022-11-03T02:19:06Z,0,0

If i had a dollar for every avatar 2 teaser ive seen in the past years on YT, then i would litterly be able to buy cheap used decent running car 🚗 IM TIRED 😫 a month ago i was going to turn 30 and i found out that i was actually 31 and i was like wtf...and the first thing i said under my breath was, dang avatar needs to come out already... dont play me dog 😤<br>I love avatar, one of my favorite things about the first move was the fact that he had no legs,  when he went into his avatar i was rooting for him the whole movie, dude litterly rised above his disability and become a beast of a fly bitten savage and  conquers everthing in his path... while finding love.. its great and the director is so dope, dude litterly went to the deepest part of the Mariana trench by himself, encapsulated in a metal highlighter colored, very expensive, submersable, that in itself is insane 😀",2022-11-03T02:18:43Z,0,0

Green Cello,"The journey continues for Jake and his family.  I find one small detail interesting actually. It isn't anything super important and has nothing to do with the plot at all. The kids. They are Na'vi, yet because of their father, an Avatar turned into one of the people, they have 5 digits on each hand. Regular Na'vi have 4 on each hand. This extra digit is a human trait. Also, I bet that the skull Quaritch is crushing into dust is his own. Knowing that he now can't return to Earth and that his human body was reduced to just bones will drive anyone one mad and want revenge.",2022-11-03T00:04:26Z,0,0

Very tight weekly deadlines, the stress levels were high, and the technical challenges for the motion editors, animators and VFX people in general were many. But seeing it all come together into this incredible master piece makes it all worth it. We hope everyone enjoys it. I cannot wait to see this movie!<br><br>EDIT: Besides the intense amount of work, there was also ALOT of fun stuff in the production of this film. Working in the film/Vfx can be fun and gives you new challenges and different ways to upskill and keep getting better. <br><br>And for those who are asking about the story....Let me just say, the movie is 3hours long, it's going to move you, it's going to touch you and it's going to blow your mind ;)",2022-11-02T23:22:25Z,5435,182

SundowN,"Nice 24fps 1080p trailer I guess? Isn't this film advertised to be revolutionary/groundbreaking for cinema in its technology and presentation? Why would you release a trailer in a fixed aspect ratio, low framerate, and extremely low bitrate? If you want the reception of emerging cinematic experiences to be positive, you have to expose viewers to those experiences in more settings than just an IMAX. Back in 2009 this would have been difficult, but it's 2022, and most phones, TV's, and personal computers can display what you are filming.",2022-11-02T23:13:13Z,1,0

Lord Trinen,"So...visually beautiful, just like the first one.  But what about the plot?  We know that the humans and Navi are righting again, for some reason, and the conflict has moved to the oceans, for some reason.  Why?  Is it over that unobtanium again?  Hope not because that was already done in the first move.  Give us some fresh angle to make it stand out compared to the first one.  At the end of the day, the plot was the first movie's weakest link as most people I speak to don't even seem to remember the plot that much, just how gorgeous the movie looked and how intense the fights were.  I'm really hoping they fix that with this movie, giving us something more to discuss than just the visuals.",2022-11-02T22:46:23Z,0,1

Since 2013 when I saw that teaser trailer I waited everyday for more information. And when it launched in late 2020 I played it all the way through, and only experienced 2 minor bugs. Thankfully. I loved it, and it’s even better now. <br><br>This movie is on the same hype level for me as that game. I can’t wait💜",2022-11-02T21:22:27Z,6,0

ABjames,Having Quaritch Avatar break his much smaller human skull by crushing it with his bare hand like it was some brittle acorn... is such a beautiful contrast to the Endoskeleton in T2 crushing a human skull with it's metal foot... and how it's even possible in both scenarios... you see a lot of this across James Cameron's films... like SIgourney Weaver trying to kill the aliens.. Queen Alien in Aliens... to her being the alien and referred to as the &quot;alien&quot; by the Na'vi in Avatar...,2022-11-02T21:12:27Z,0,0

I, too, saw this film in 3-D when it came out. I too bought a 3-D tv (which I still enjoy!) as a result.  But Cameron's been to busy to look after the 3-D Revolution he supposedly started with the first &quot;Avatar.&quot;  <br>Well-- if this film is not readily available in theatres in 3-D as promised all these years ago, then I will be skipping it.  After all, &quot;Avatar&quot; itself is not a  particularly original story (can you say &quot;Dances With Wolves?&quot;) and a sequel, spectacular though it may be, NEEDS the 3-D to complete the spectacle of the presentation, which can be great!<br>So-- I am waiting for the announcement that &quot;Avatar: The Way of Water&quot; is being shown in 3-D (IMAX, preferably).

ddduh,Have fun tricking this next generation into thinking this is anything close to interesting...the color of these films is just awful.  The story is overdone sappy dribble that could have been told with significantly less funding.  This will have hype when released and then die after the theaters.  Avatar is so gross.

Just nuke their dumb tree from orbit, so simple. Or use napalm and agent orange, we had that in the 60's.

Now don't get me wrong I think the special effects in this movie look very amazing and stunning, but I also want the story to be just as good as how the trailer looks. But at the same time I do have extreme faith in James Cameron because one of the reasons as to why he is one of my favorite movie directors is because he is a masterful storyteller when it comes to his previous movies (however I am pretty split in his first Avatar movie when it comes to story). But that's just me. In the end, I'm pretty sure I am really going to like the movie overall especially if I'm going to see it in theaters in 4DX 3D for the experience. All I'm just saying is that I want this movie to be a classic.",2022-11-02T20:11:42Z,1,0

I grew up with no Wifi at home. So no chance for me to see anything before I went to see the movie. I never regretted my choice. I´m 26 now. Watched the first Avatar movie at least 200 times, if not more, and I can´t wait to finally explore more of this amazing world! I´m a very emotional person and this trailer made me cry because of the connection I feel to the world of Pandora!

Iva Bořilová,"I was 8 when Avatar came out. I was with my family in the shopping centre and we walked by cinema and I saw the poster with Avatar. I can´t describe the feelings I got. I don´t know why. It usually doesn´t happen to me. I could get the poster out of my mind. I even draw a picture of Neytiri. I was dreaming about it since then. I really wanted to see the movie, but everybody told me I´m too young to understand it. Time was passing and I forgot on it. But one day I was with my family watching TV and we saw a cinema advertisement with Avatar. And I immidiately got that indescribable feeling. &quot;I MUST watch it&quot; I told myself. So I did it. Before that I even saw a trailer in a TV which made me want to see it even more and bought myself an Avatar the game which is stunnig! And then , after ten years of waiting, when I was 18, my dream finally came true!!! I remember the day like it was yesterday. It was day before my summer holiday. I was sitting and sipping Monster and watching. Sometimes I even forgot to breathe. It was simply breathtaking!!! After the end I was lying in my bed and thinking about it, because I wasnt´t able to do anything. I even spent my entire holiday thinking about it. It left such a deep impresion on me. And now I´m almost 22 and Avatar 2 is finally here!!!! Thank you Mr. Cameron ❤and others ❤and you guys because it wouldn´t be possible withou us, FANS!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤(And guess what. When I saw this trailer, the indescribable feeling that I never felt again since then, after all these years, IT WAS HERE AGAIN!!!!❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤) I wish I could describe it, but I can´t. Does anybody has the same problem or it´s just me? And do you have story with Avatar like me?❤❤❤❤❤❤",2022-11-02T20:05:06Z,4,0

Things are too epic and fantastical. Makes reality seem boring and dreary.

It might be a reflection of her own heartbeat. Kiri might be Grace reincarnated. The Na’vi say that every person is born twice. The second is when you earn your place among the people. This is her second life, and Grace has earned her place among the people.",2022-11-02T19:26:20Z,26,1

Now they have to rely on the story to draw an audience.<br><br>Will cross a billion, but in time and not much more than that.

Because you just know that Cameron and his writing partners aren't gonna take any kind of Chris/Jonah Nolan-like narrative risks (which I for one am VERY OK with). And certainly not when you need to assuage the suits into giving you the kinds of dollars needed to make all four movies a reality. But Disney made a smart decision here to focus on the beauty of Pandora over the action.

This time there's those characters you remember like Sully? Like Monsters Inc. Sully? Ripley? No wait, that's Sigourney Weaver in Alien. Did Cameron do one of those? Wait. Is the Small Soliders looking miliraty troupe guy in this one too? Did he die? Honestly I remember like nothing from this movie except the weird tail sex, Giovanni Ribisi trying real hard, unoriginal-name-tadium, and the headache from those 3-D glasses - are now in underwater.

The way Kiri said mighty much like how Neytiri spoke of her great great grandfather and how Jake said strong heart at the end just like when Neytiri told him he has a strong heart. Really shows how much of an impact Neytiri's had on her family AND can we appreciate Sigourney Weavers performance for Kiri???

It was like being at a sports event. Then they did a countdown from 10. Such an unforgettable movie going experience.",2022-11-02T17:53:53Z,2864,61

I can't wait to see the next part of the film that made me love cinema, that made me see that another reality was possible through the creation of images. Which gave me chills like I've never had before. I want to be able to go back to being the child I was in that seat, the child who was amazed by every scene and who was transported by the first movie.

This one's going to carry on that tradition, and we all need a bit of sci-fi fun with love and care put into it right now.

Darkon 4580,I'm not particularly excited about this movie since the first one was super generic in terms of story. The only reason people even talk about the first movie is because of the visuals and CGI which are incredible especially for 2009. But if it wasn't for those things then everyone would've instantly forgotten about it. I might go see this movie anyway because I am curious if they actually did anything new with the story.,2022-11-02T17:16:00Z,0,0

Monty J.,"To hell with the naysayers. I'm cautiously optimistic about this movie. It's probably the most excited I've been when it comes a major blockbuster event. So tired with all the superhero crap and just want something fresh.<br><br>No doubt the CGI will be pushing the envelope once again but here's hoping that the story will catch us all by a surprise. I'm not asking for much but I don't want it to be a popcorn flick at best. Too many movies offer that at this point. <br><br>Also, here's hoping that this movie will be as traditional as they come without any of that wokeness which has been plaguing Western civilization. Thought-provoking, sure. Challenging themes which can reflect the real world, why not? The first movie was basically about neocolonialism. If they have to tackle controversial themes then do it the smart way rather than whatever it is others are trying to attempt in this day and age.",2022-11-02T17:14:26Z,0,0

I was so confused but at the same time, I was having the time of my life watching the whole thing. Avatar has been my favorite movie for years and I've been waiting for the sequels ever since. I'm so happy its almost here! Also, I love hearing Sigourney Weaver's voice again!",2022-11-02T16:54:31Z,1899,47

I am afraid that they're going to shoehorn some coming-of-age story where it isn't needed, but given how they told the first, I'm expecting they'll do it really well. I just hope they focus on what they've already built, but most importantly, that they don't pull a Disney and just throw it all out and rely on brand-recognition for this. I want this to really be Avatar 2, not some cheap knockoff Avatar that relies on something other than the movie's own greatness to pull in viewers.",2022-11-02T16:52:28Z,0,0

What's that, bid bad industrial humans who are greedy for resources are coming to destroy it?

And by the way humans = bad, did we mention that?&quot; <br><br>It's not strictly speaking a terrible story, it just looks repetitive and too similar to the first movies story.

The Capped Filmmaker,"Let’s be honest . . .<br>People have their gripes with Avatar, but I can personally guarantee that this movie will be one of the best movies of the year, the amount of work and love that goes into the VFX of not only this movie but the first Avatar is insane. So even if the plot and story is terrible, you will receive what film was meant to be, a portal to a world you have never experienced in your life. Welcome To Pandora 🦋",2022-11-02T15:45:10Z,1,0

This looks very promising, the CGI looks even better than the original, you can actually see its evolution. <br>What I find very interesting, and I hope James Cameron went that way,  is to see 2 species that come from a planet that has mostly water and the way they use that environment to their favor, I guess Pandora's Na'vi civilization, based on their naturally networked biosphere learned how to harness it so to peacefully coexist with its surroundings and we humans invented tech to control it for our &quot;financial&quot; benefit. It is going to be an epic battle for sure. This goes down to the core beliefs and way of life of 2 very different sentient beings.",2022-11-02T15:18:23Z,0,0

Sahib Preet Singh,"I always wondered how they could top the first one's CGI but they seemed to have nailed it beautifully. I am not a big fan of CGI, especially how it is used basically everywhere, but i do love it when it is done exceptionally well and only when necessary. It will definitely set a benchmark in CGI just like the first one, which no movie can beat for another decade or so. Great VFX needs time and we can clearly see the amount of effort put into this, the trailer alone shows how much potential the VFX artists have and how other studios especially Marvel are just wasting it with their short production times.",2022-11-02T15:17:34Z,20,0

I think the original worked because of this contrast between the real world and this incredible fantastical one and it was something we have seen before. I think without that it just looks like a very well designed animated national geographic documentary but with aliens...no excitement from this trailer whatsover, Cameron was making this for 20 years, dont get why!",2022-11-02T15:13:29Z,0,0

Glen Smith,"I doubt very much it will ever capture the first Avatar experience that millions of us had at the cinema in 3D. So-much-so, we bought a gorgeous slimline Panasonic 3D plasma with Avatar (and two others)  specifically made for the tv with the settings used on Panasonic cameras that were used filming (courtesy of James Cameron himself). Copies of Avatar were being sold and bought on eBay for over 300 each! As they were licensed only to Panasonic for a duration of a couple years I think. I also remember there being issues with cinema goers who wanted to actually live in Pandora, the 3D was so mind blowing and it altered their mindset mentally. Such was the power. <br>2D was the dullest it could be portrayed and wasn’t meant to be viewed.  We, after all, view the world in 3D - not a lot of people think about that before they diss 3D. We have stereoscopic vision. The ‘flatscreen’ is a true word. Which is why this generation don’t even watch TV.",2022-11-02T15:03:38Z,0,0

The selling point of the first movie was the 3d being used for the first time in theaters and the technological leap in CGI that media entertainment was making at the time. None of that is there this go around. We have 13 years now of CGI mindless drivel under our belts now. Along with video games. I just dont see this movie captivating the audiences this time.,2022-11-02T14:50:12Z,0,0

Mitrik Gaduk,"So I've got a mildly serious question.. What platforms is it coming out on? Playstation 6? Xbox Series Y?.. I say this is a mildly serious question because.. If this had &quot;Cinematic Trailer&quot; instead of &quot;Official Trailer&quot;, I would've thought it was a trailer for a Game.. That's not to say that the CG is bad, on the contrary, it's a compliment to just how good some games look at this point. We're at the stage where games are looking closer and closer to the uncanny valley and this.. Is Avatar.. No, I mean it's like Avatar on Next-Gen hardware.. That's not a compliment.<br><br>The story will probably be good, don't get me wrong, I just feel like we've been spoiled to hell with games that look so incredibly batshit insane, it almost puts this film to shame. It's like we went from Last Gen to Current Gen, Avatar 2009 to Avatar 2022 with a Next-Gen patch, yeah? I'm not saying it's not visually impressive, but for context, Avatar 2009 was one of the most (if not THE most) impressive looking films at the time of it's release. It was beyond all of it's competition.<br><br>But this.. Yeah, it's cool. I'm happy it's finally coming out.. But I'm not exactly impressed. Again, personally I think the story will matter a lot more to me, so hopefully this isn't JUST here for the CGI.",2022-11-02T14:44:13Z,1,0

Nazmul Hasan,"So many emotional people on here who were just kids when the first film was released. True, authentic nostalgia; not the manufactured version of nostalgia we see in these reboots. Avatar belongs to you guys, to a whole generation who grew into adults waiting for this movie. It belongs to you guys and the people who are no longer with us but who believed in this world. It feels like meeting a long-time friend you thought you'd never see again. You don't think about them every day, they become a memory in a small corner of the mind and you continue your life as always but, when you find them there, without warning, nostalgia strikes you. Your eyes become shiny. And then you think, &quot;Maybe, deep down, I've always waited for you.&quot; But the truth is, deep down, they never left. This is what Star Wars was to my generation. Enjoy it, treasure it and don't let the haters bring you down to their level.",2022-11-02T14:33:12Z,3,0

Dragnoth Lecoona,"bro, why do they need to keep shitting on human's with these movies, humans would absolutely beat their asses. Ever heard of an atomic bomb. Pretty sure, they would just drop a single bomb on their location after what they went through in the first movie, or unleash a full on invasion of the planet. A million men army would be far stronger then anything that the aliens in this movie could stop. Also, Jake is a freekin traitor, pretty sure, they wouldn't let something like that go lightly. It seems that humans have been going way to easy on them, and frankly, they should just park a destroyer above the planet, and bombard them from orbit, just to get rid of them as that would frankly be the easiest and safest move, basically destroying a single local region for two reasons, to show their power/scare the crap out of them, and also to destroy any of their armies. Sure they can hide in a jungle, but what if you remove that jungle, plus, any kind of fire, would spread very rapidly desolating the entire region. With a single missile, you could whip out most of them, and if they have to, humans can relocate to a part of the planet that the alien tribe would have no ability to reach them at, like the other side of the planet. Also, humans, despite being smaller, would be way way stronger then any of the aliens, and even a single human, could probably tear the arms off of an alien possibly with ease as Earth has a much higher gravity then that alien world. It would be like a gorilla vs a human with no equipment. gorilla wins. Human vs alien, human wins. Plus human has gun, gun one-shot alien. Even the bigger animals on the world would be made mincemeat out of, as if these humans are suppose to be higher tech level then we are now, their guns, should be able to shoot bullets, that would shred the insides of the alien animals. Also, a human would be able to jump higher then the aliens in the movie, which is not something you saw in the first movie, the world has a low gravity, humans, being stronger then the aliens, it would be like if you were walking on mars. The average human could jump probably like 9 to 12 feet in the air.",2022-11-02T14:28:47Z,0,0

nathan masi,James Cameron once said he's the King of the world and now he's out to put his money where his mouth is. I can not think of a film director that can stage actions sequences as superbly as Mr Cameron! Take the helicopter and truck chase scene from Judgement day. That was fast and furious picasso style long before F&amp;F was even an idea. This guy takes what otherwise mindless block buster action and turn it into art. He doesn't have to be compared to Scorsese or Spielberg because he simply is James Cameron!!! All hail!,2022-11-02T14:16:31Z,0,0

In font of humans they may look like other beings. But individually they are toys... But i don't have to teach them how to do cinema. This is just my opinion 😄,2022-11-02T14:10:22Z,1,0

Looking back at it years later with a new lense, the visuals are still great however the plot is generic in some areas along with the main protagonists growth/journey and I’m just kinda over it. It didn’t age as well over time like the Dark Knight did.

We have games that come out unfinished because the fanbase is angry in waiting, and the producers/corporations are rushing to get the game out the door for sales that the product is so piss poor in execution. James Cameron over these past 13 years, furthered the technology of not only 3-D and CGI, but he was also working as a documentarian as well as writing &amp; directing these Avatar sequels. He is a perfectionist and always has been. This shows the patience he took to making these films, as if anyone has EVER heard, Cameron is quite hot headed at times and wants to move quickly. If he chooses this speed in releasing Avatar sequels, I will respect that and live in the moment when I am finally sitting in the theater with my 15 year old who loves Avatar, together!",2022-11-02T14:06:37Z,0,4

I distinctly remember watching the first movie in the franchise when I was eight or nine, and I’m 21 now, so obviously its been ages since then. It’s cool to see that the graphics and effects have improved so much over the last 13 years or so. Its becoming more and more realistic.

I distinctly remember watching the first movie in the franchise when I was eight or nine, and I’m 21 now, so obviously its been ages since then. It’s cool to see that the graphics and effects have improved so much over the last 13 years or so. Its becoming more and more realistic. Sam Worthington, Zoe Saldana, Sigourney Weaver and many more already have the capacity to make this film a life changing event for all of us here.

I think a lot of pepople forget how hyped the original movie was for its '3D tech' and amazing motion capture work. But im not seeing anything here that any other studio with a big enough budget and enough processing power couldnt do. Waited for over a decade and this is what Cameron thinks wil impress people?

When I turned 18, he kind of disappeared from my life, with a brief reappearance for a few months in 2021 before disappearing again. He passed away in January and I still haven't processed that. I'm the closest to getting in touch with my emotions regarding all that when watching those &quot;Avatar 2&quot; trailers. I wanna go to the cinema to see it but seeing how those 2 minutes can very nearly make me tear up, idk if I'd be able to",2022-11-02T13:43:26Z,1,2

kummer45,Smurf adventures are not my cup of tea. The problem with these movies IS THE SCRIPT. The first had that issue now its Atreus copy paste from God of War IV. <br><br>Smurf movies needs SMART versus military armies that are not simpletons or straight forward villains. There should be a real conflict that is elaborated and well planed. Sadly Cameron crew is not for such approach.,2022-11-02T13:30:50Z,0,0

I enjoyed the first one a ton, let's hope this one will deliver something spectacular when it comes to the story, as when it comes to visuals i'm sure it will be amazing.

Jason Thompson,"James Cameron and his writers Rick Jaffa &amp; Amanda Silver (Planet of Apes series) Josh Friedman (War Of the Worlds) and Shane Salerno (Savages) have been working on Avatar 2, 3 &amp; 4 scripts for atleast 5 years now.  Probably more.  They all wrote the stories together, then Cameron assigned them individual scripts to write.  He stuck these writers in their own room, then he would go from room to room co-writing each script.  It was either a nightmare or a dream come true because you have to figure, in the end, these writers would have spent seven or eight years working on these scripts!!",2022-11-02T13:23:14Z,0,0

He's one of the most secretive producers in entertainment. I'm excited to see the evolution of digital animation and the work that was put in on this project. It's going to be spectacular!

You can notice stuttering almost as if it is a npc character from a video game talking during dialogue scenes. The visuals are amazing and the plot seems great, but from what ive been used to elsewhere with marvel and other massive cgi movies over the last few years, this is defo a let down.

Maybe I’ll see this and maybe it’ll ignite that excitement once again, but this trailer feels like a remake of the first movie but in water instead of in the air.",2022-11-02T13:18:50Z,1,0

JC Moran,"James Cameron is a Master ...And all he touches turns into Magnificency ,  but this series  Avatar is something only Cameron could do , The actors picked are Exactly Pure for the part and role in this series , and the story is something that we feel this days, Struggle  in a world that looks like its slowly walking into abyss and yet always so close to salvation due to shear power of all its living on it , this story reminds us values , what is important in life and what we should be remembered in the future for  everything around it was created in perfect harmony and the balance of this harmony will alway be in check by gree and other souls that will never reach the understanding spot of the importance of everything around them,  A tree a rock , a mountain  and an Eagle, an Elk ,a tiger , a man or woman , everything its part of a balanced stability that if shaken will only lead to nature rebelion ... Love the meaning of all this Cameron creation and by God it is beautiful to think we could make our world much better than it is ! Can't wait to see this second part , but again Cameron is a Master !",2022-11-02T13:12:25Z,0,0

If he was serious about expanding this franchise then this is definately the right direction, hopefully the storytelling holds up since the first was just a 3D tech demo with dances-with-wolves slapped on",2022-11-02T13:11:49Z,0,0

It's a universal message. Looking forward to this and will most likely see this as many times as I saw the original in theatres. 7 times.
